# KordEx 1.4.4-RC1

**Note:** This release contains breaking changes for the checks system. **All custom checks must be rewritten!** If you
need help figuring this out, please let us know on Discord.

Changes since 1.4.2:

* Update to KordEx 0.8.0-M1
* Default to rest-aware caching and allow configuration of caching strategy
* Add kotlinx.datetime converters and utils
* Add support for select menus in the `Components` builder
* Add support for Discord's slash command perms, including enforcing them at the framework level
* Add support for threads, including extra checks that only operate on threads or flatten them to top channels
* Trim slash command arguments to workaround inconsistent data from Discord
* Redo the checks system, requiring calls to one of the `fail` functions to fail a check
  * **This is breaking, checks must be redone**
  * Checks may now also return a failure message for commands
