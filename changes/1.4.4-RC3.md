# KordEx 1.4.4-RC3

Changes since 1.4.4-RC2:

* Update to Kord 0.8.0-M4
* Checks are now consistent in behaviour regarding events that they don't support - negating checks (containing the word `not`) will always pass in this situation, and all other checks will always fail in this situation.
* Paginator `Page` objects are now backed by a Kord `EmbedBuilder`, and should be constructed using the builder syntax. For example: `Page(bundle) { description = "This is a page." }`
* The `ExtensionEvent` class now extends Kord's `Event` type, with a shard number of `-1`
* The `guildFor()` function for `InteractionCreateEvent`s was changed to manually get the guild from the interaction data, as it can otherwise be missing in some situations

Documentation work is still ongoing, and KordEx will see more changes as things are documented - the documentation process makes it really easy to see (and change) things that don't make intuitive sense.

The following issues were solved in this release:

* [#65](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions/issues/65): Make ActionableComponentBuilder's ID customizable
* [#66](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions/issues/66): Add the addition emoji helpers from ButtonBuilder to SelectOptionBuilder
* [#67](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions/issues/67): Paginators, pages do no support embed fields
